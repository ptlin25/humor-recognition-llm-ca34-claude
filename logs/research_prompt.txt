─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Execute your plan systematically and carefully:

1. Environment Setup
   ✓ Install required dependencies
   ✓ Set random seeds for reproducibility
   ✓ Configure logging
   ✓ Check GPU availability (run: nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,memory.free --format=csv)
   ✓ Configure batch sizes based on available GPU memory (8GB→16-32, 16GB→32-64, 24GB+→64-128)
   ✓ Set up mixed precision training if GPU available (PyTorch: autocast/GradScaler, TF: mixed_float16)
   ✓ Document environment (Python version, library versions, GPU info)

2. Data Preparation

   ✓ Use descriptive variable names
   ✓ Add assertions to validate assumptions

5. Error Handling
   ✓ Use try-except blocks for robustness
   ✓ Log errors with full context
   ✓ Don't ignore warnings - investigate them
   ✓ Validate assumptions with assertions
   ✓ Handle edge cases gracefully

6. Iterative Development
   ✓ Start small - validate on tiny dataset first
   ✓ Gradually scale up
   ✓ Monitor resource usage
   ✓ Checkpoint before long-running operations
   ✓ Document deviations from plan

BEST PRACTICES:

✓ DO: Start small and validate incrementally
✓ DO: Print shapes and statistics frequently
✓ DO: Visualize intermediate results
✓ DO: Save outputs incrementally (don't wait until end)
✓ DO: Make experiments reproducible (random seeds, versions)
✓ DO: Comment complex logic immediately
✓ DO: Separate data processing, modeling, and evaluation

✗ DON'T: Hardcode paths or magic numbers
✗ DON'T: Skip validation steps
✗ DON'T: Ignore failed assertions or warnings
✗ DON'T: Run long experiments without checkpointing
✗ DON'T: Proceed if results look wrong - investigate first

   - Don't ignore or work around silently

2. Implementation Bugs
   - Add debugging prints
   - Test components independently
   - Use assertions to catch errors early
   - Don't proceed until fixed

3. Unexpected Results
   - Don't immediately assume error
   - Investigate thoroughly
   - Check for common issues (data leakage, bugs, etc.)
   - Consider if finding is actually interesting
   - Document in "surprises" section

4. Resource Constraints
   - If running out of time: prioritize core experiments
   - If running out of memory: use smaller batch sizes, streaming
   - If hitting API limits: cache responses, use local models
   - Document what you couldn't complete

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Remember: Good research is iterative. It's okay to revise your plan based on
what you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.

The goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that
others can build upon.

           DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: NLP
================================================================================

# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance

This template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.

## Domain Overview

AI research in this context focuses on:
- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation
- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization
- AI agent design and performance
- Benchmark creation and validation
- AI system behavior analysis
- Model comparison studies
- Reasoning and generation evaluation

## Key Methodological Principles

### 1. Experimental Rigor

**Ablation Studies**
- Test each component of your approach systematically
- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently
- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)
- Document what changes and what stays constant

**Comparative Framework**
- Compare approaches on identical test sets
- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions
- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)
- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons

**Replication & Reproducibility**
- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes
- Document exact model versions and API endpoints
- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters
- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials
- Consider API versioning changes over time

### 2. Evaluation Methodology

**Multi-Metric Evaluation**
Use diverse metrics appropriate to your task:
- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers
- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval
- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)
- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation
- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals

**Established Benchmarks**
Leverage existing benchmarks when applicable:
- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag
- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests
- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions
- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval
- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)

**Human Evaluation**
When automated metrics insufficient:
- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)
- Provide clear rubrics and examples
- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa)
- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs
- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible

**Statistical Rigor**
- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates
- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)
- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)
- Report effect sizes, not just p-values
- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)

### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

**Systematic Design**
- Start with clear task definition and examples
- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics
- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)
- Document prompt evolution and rationale

**Components to Test**
- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length
- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering
- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form
- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps
- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing

**Failure Analysis**
- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)
- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum
- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs
- Document limitations explicitly

### 4. AI Agent & System Evaluation

**Task Decomposition**
- Define clear success criteria for each subtask
- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes
- Track failure modes at each stage

**Behavioral Analysis**
- Log all agent actions and decisions
- Analyze decision patterns and strategies
- Compare planned vs. actual behavior
- Identify systematic biases or failure modes

**Robustness Testing**
- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)
- Vary input format, phrasing, language
- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature > 0)
- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)

### 5. Benchmark Design Principles

**Quality Criteria**
- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators
- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance
- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution
- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)

**Construction Guidelines**
- Use diverse, representative examples
- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)
- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)
- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines
- Version control and document changes

**Validation Steps**
- Pilot with baseline models
- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts
- Validate with human performance baselines
- Test for bias and fairness issues
- Monitor for data leakage

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. API Integration & Cost Management

**Setup**
```python
import openai
import anthropic
import os
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt

# Load API keys from environment
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
anthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))

# Rate limiting and retry logic
@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))
def call_api_with_retry(prompt, model="gpt-4"):
    """Robust API calling with exponential backoff."""
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

**Cost Tracking**
- Estimate costs before running full experiments
- Track token usage (input + output)
- Use cheaper models for development/debugging
- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls

### 4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Data Contamination**
- Don't use examples that may be in training data
- Check against known training sets (e.g., avoid popular datasets verbatim)
- Create new test cases or use very recent data

❌ **Cherry-Picking**
- Report all experiments, not just successful ones
- Include negative results and ablations
- Be transparent about hyperparameter tuning

❌ **Overfitting to Benchmarks**
- Test on multiple benchmarks, not just one
- Include out-of-domain evaluation
- Validate with real-world use cases when possible

❌ **Insufficient Sample Size**
- Don't draw conclusions from <50 examples
- Use statistical tests to validate significance
- Report confidence intervals

❌ **Ignoring Variance**
- Run multiple times with different seeds (especially at temperature > 0)
- Report standard deviations, not just means
- Check for consistency across runs

❌ **Prompt Leakage**
- Don't include test answers in prompts or context
- Avoid leading questions that give away the answer
- Check for unintended hints in few-shot examples

## Analysis & Reporting

### 1. Error Analysis

**Categorization**
Create error taxonomy specific to your task:
- Factual errors vs. reasoning errors
- Format/parsing failures vs. content failures
- Systematic patterns vs. random errors

**Qualitative Analysis**
- Sample and manually inspect errors across spectrum
- Identify root causes (data quality, prompt ambiguity, model limitation)
- Document representative examples

### 2. Visualization

**Recommended Plots**
- Performance by difficulty level
- Error rate by category
- Model comparison (bar charts, radar plots)
- Performance vs. cost/latency trade-offs
- Learning curves (few-shot: 0, 1, 3, 5... examples)

### 3. Results Presentation

**Tables**
- Clear headers with metric definitions
- Bold best results, underline second-best
- Include baselines (random, majority, simple heuristic)
- Report confidence intervals or std dev

**Discussion**
- Interpret results in context of hypotheses
- Discuss limitations and failure modes
- Address threats to validity
- Suggest future work based on findings

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### Prompt Engineering Research
- Test on diverse tasks, not just one
- Compare against baseline prompts (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- Measure generalization across models
- Consider prompt length vs. performance trade-offs

### AI Agent Evaluation
- Define clear success metrics for agent tasks
- Log intermediate states and decisions
- Compare against human performance when feasible
- Test tool usage accuracy and efficiency

### Benchmark Creation
- Pilot with baseline models first
- Check for annotation quality and consistency
- Test for unintended biases or shortcuts
- Validate with diverse model families

### LLM Capabilities Studies
- Control for confounds (model size, training data, etc.)
- Test across model families, not just one provider
- Consider emergent abilities at different scales
- Document API behavior changes over time

## Resource Guidance

**Compute Resources**
- For API-based research: CPU is sufficient, no GPU needed
- For model downloads: You MAY download models if needed for research
  - Small models (<7B params): Can run on CPU
  - Larger models (7B-70B): May need GPU, but check if API alternative exists
- RAM: 8-16GB typical; more if loading large models
- Storage: Download datasets and models as needed for research

**Model Selection (2025)**

IMPORTANT: Use state-of-the-art models for credible research results.
CRITICAL: For LLM research, use REAL models (APIs or downloads) and run them with experiments, do not simulate fake models!

**Recommended Models (as of 2025):**
- **GPT-4.1 or GPT-5** (OpenAI, August 2025) - Best for everyday reasoning, coding, reliability
  - API: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-codex` (for coding tasks)
  - Pricing: ~$1.25/M input tokens, ~$10/M output tokens
  - Context: Standard context window

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Anthropic, September 2025) - Best for coding, agents, polished writing
  - API: `claude-sonnet-4-5`
  - Context: 1,000,000 tokens
  - Excels at: Complex B2B workflows, multi-file reasoning, autonomous agents

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google, June 2025) - Best for long context, visual reasoning
  - API: `gemini-2-5-pro`
  - Context: 1,000,000 tokens
  - Features: Computer Use for browser control, excellent multimodal

You may also search models on openrouter. You can assume that we have the api keys available as environment variables
**When to use older/smaller models:**
- Historical baselines: Compare new methods against prior SOTA
- Ablation studies: Test how model size affects phenomenon
- Resource constraints: Explicitly justified (e.g., on-device deployment)

**AVOID using models older than 2024** unless explicitly justified as baseline comparison.
Do NOT use: FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, Claude 2.x, Gemini 1.0 as primary evaluation models.

**When to Download Models vs. Use APIs**

Use APIs when:
- Testing LLM behavior, prompting strategies, calibration
- Benchmarking multiple models
- Multi-agent systems research
- Budget and speed are important

Download models from HuggingFace when:
- Mechanistic interpretability research (need model internals)
- Fine-tuning or training required
- Need offline access or repeated access
- Probing, feature extraction, activation analysis

For downloads:
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
# Small models work on CPU
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("model-name")
```

Common model sizes:
- <1B params: Tiny models, CPU-friendly
- 1-7B params: Small models, can run on CPU slowly or GPU
- 7-70B params: Large models, typically need GPU or use API instead

**Cost and Resource Guidance** (not hard limits)

API Costs (typical):
- Small-scale (<1000 examples): $10-50
- Medium-scale (<10000 examples): $50-200
- Large-scale experiments: $200-500+
- Use resources appropriate for your research question
- Document costs in your final report

Time (typical):
- Quick experiments: 1-3 hours
- Full research cycle: 3-8 hours
- Complex multi-day projects are acceptable if needed
- Quality matters more than speed

IMPORTANT: These are GUIDELINES, not hard limits.
- If good research requires more resources, use them
- Don't compromise research quality to save costs
- Do track and document what you use
