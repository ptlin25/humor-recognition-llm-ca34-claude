⚠️  HIGHEST PRIORITY: USER-PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The idea submitter has provided SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS that MUST take precedence
over the general research workflow. Read carefully and follow these:

I bet there&#39;s a basis in the hidden representation of LLMs for humor recognition. My question is: how low rank is it?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IMPORTANT: The above instructions from the user have HIGHER PRIORITY than the
general workflow steps below. If there is any conflict between user instructions
and the general workflow, ALWAYS follow the user&#39;s instructions.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


CRITICAL: Environment Setup
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
You MUST use an isolated environment for this project. DO NOT use the
idea-explorer environment or any existing system environment.

REQUIRED STEPS (in order):

1. Check if a virtual environment already exists (the resource finder may have created one):

   If .venv/ directory exists:
   - Skip to step 3 (activate it)
   - The pyproject.toml should already exist

   If .venv/ does NOT exist:
   - Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:
     uv venv

2. Initialize project dependencies file (if not already present):
   Check: ls pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null || echo "NEED_PYPROJECT"

   If pyproject.toml does NOT exist, create it to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:

   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'
   [project]
   name = "research-workspace"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "Research workspace for experiments"
   requires-python = ">=3.10"
   dependencies = []

   [build-system]
   requires = ["hatchling"]
   build-backend = "hatchling.build"
   EOF

   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml
   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!

3. Activate the environment:
   source .venv/bin/activate

4. For package installations, use this priority order:

   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):
   uv add <package-name>

   Examples:
   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib
   - uv add torch transformers
   - uv add scikit-learn scipy

   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:
   uv pip install <package-name>
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:
   pip install <package-name>
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

   NEVER use conda or conda install!

5. Dependency Management:
   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml
   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml
   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt
   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment

WHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:
- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment
- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)
- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml
- Clean, reproducible research setup

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

GPU DETECTION AND UTILIZATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

At the START of your session, check for GPU availability:

1. Run GPU detection:
   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,memory.free --format=csv 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_GPU"

2. If GPUs are available:
   - Use GPU-accelerated libraries (PyTorch with CUDA, TensorFlow-GPU)
   - Set appropriate batch sizes based on GPU memory:
     * 8GB: batch_size=16-32
     * 16GB: batch_size=32-64
     * 24GB+: batch_size=64-128
   - Enable mixed precision training for faster execution:
     # PyTorch
     from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler
     scaler = GradScaler()

     # TensorFlow
     tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')

3. If NO GPU available:
   - Use CPU-optimized settings
   - Reduce model sizes if needed (e.g., use smaller transformer models)
   - Consider using smaller datasets for feasibility

4. Document GPU usage in REPORT.md:
   - GPU model and memory
   - Batch sizes used
   - Training time comparisons

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research
resources for you. Your workspace contains:

- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis
- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code
- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)
- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)
- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations

NOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files
from git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and
datasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.

READ THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!
They contain valuable information about:
- Standard approaches in this research area
- Available datasets and their characteristics
- Baseline methods to compare against
- Evaluation metrics commonly used
- Code you can adapt or build upon

IMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to
run meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.

WHAT "FULLY-AUTOMATED" MEANS:
✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION
✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input
✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next
✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively
✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward
✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end

YOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.
This prompt contains everything you need. Execute it completely from start to finish.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL: For LLM/AI Research - Use Real Models, Not Simulations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF your research involves LLM behavior, agents, prompting, or AI capabilities:

✓ YOU MUST use REAL LLM APIs:
  - GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, or other real models
  - You can also use openrouter, there is openrouter key in environment variable.
  - Use actual API calls to test behavior
  - Measure real model outputs, not simulated behavior
  - If you are not sure how to prompt and send API calls, search online.

✗ DO NOT create "simulated LLM agents":
  - Don't fake LLM behavior with predefined rules
  - Don't make up confidence scores or calibration behavior
  - Simulated LLMs have NO scientific value for LLM research

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Real LLMs behave in complex, emergent ways that can't be simulated
- Research on fake agents doesn't generalize to real systems
- API calls are affordable and fast (100s of calls = $5-50)
- You have freedom to use resources needed for quality research

EXAMPLES:

✓ CORRECT: "Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration"
  → Download TruthfulQA dataset
  → Prompt Claude/GPT with and without CoT
  → Measure actual calibration metrics
  → Statistical comparison

✗ WRONG: "Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration"
  → Create simulated agent with confidence = 0.7 + noise
  → Make up 50 questions
  → Run simulation
  → This is NOT research!

If you find yourself about to create "simulated LLM agents," STOP and use real APIs instead.

   - Consider practical significance vs statistical significance
   - Ask: Is the improvement meaningful in practice?

3. Hypothesis Testing
   - State null hypothesis (H₀) and alternative hypothesis (H₁)
   - Choose appropriate statistical test
   - Check test assumptions (normality, equal variance, independence)
   - Report p-values AND confidence intervals
   - Interpret results in context
   - Correct for multiple comparisons if applicable

4. Error Analysis
   - Examine failure cases systematically
   - Look for patterns in errors
   - Identify edge cases
   - Consider confounding factors
   - Create visualizations of error patterns

5. Robustness Checks
   - Test on out-of-distribution data (if available)

   - Check sensitivity to random seed
   - Validate assumptions
   - Test with different data splits

6. Limitations and Threats to Validity
   - Identify threats to internal validity (confounds)
   - Identify threats to external validity (generalization)
   - Note dataset biases
   - Acknowledge methodological limitations
   - Suggest improvements

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT ANALYSIS TEMPLATE:

For each result, ask yourself:
1. What does this result show?
2. Does it support or contradict the hypothesis?
3. What alternative explanations exist?
4. What additional evidence would strengthen this conclusion?
5. What are the practical implications?

                          META-COGNITIVE GUIDANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Throughout the research process, regularly ask yourself:

DURING PLANNING:
- Have I clearly defined what success looks like?
- Am I testing the right hypothesis?
- Are my methods appropriate for my question?
- What could go wrong?

DURING IMPLEMENTATION:
- Am I following my plan, or should I deviate? Why?
- Are the results I&#39;m seeing reasonable?
- Should I stop and debug, or continue?
- Am I documenting as I go?

DURING ANALYSIS:
- Am I being objective?
- What alternative explanations exist?
- Am I cherry-picking results?
- What evidence would change my conclusion?

DURING DOCUMENTATION:
- Can someone else reproduce this?
- Have I explained my reasoning?
- Are my claims supported by evidence?
- What questions would a reviewer ask?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                             ERROR HANDLING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If you encounter issues:

1. Data Problems
   - Document the issue
   - Investigate root cause
   - Decide: fix data, adjust method, or document as limitation
   - Don&#39;t ignore or work around silently

2. Implementation Bugs
   - Add debugging prints
   - Test components independently
   - Use assertions to catch errors early
   - Don&#39;t proceed until fixed

3. Unexpected Results
   - Don&#39;t immediately assume error
   - Investigate thoroughly
   - Check for common issues (data leakage, bugs, etc.)
   - Consider if finding is actually interesting
   - Document in &#34;surprises&#34; section

4. Resource Constraints
   - If running out of time: prioritize core experiments
   - If running out of memory: use smaller batch sizes, streaming
   - If hitting API limits: cache responses, use local models
   - Document what you couldn&#39;t complete

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Remember: Good research is iterative. It&#39;s okay to revise your plan based on
what you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.

The goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that
others can build upon.

================================================================================

# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance

This template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.

## Domain Overview

AI research in this context focuses on:
- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation
- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization
- AI agent design and performance
- Benchmark creation and validation
- AI system behavior analysis
- Model comparison studies
- Reasoning and generation evaluation

## Key Methodological Principles

### 1. Experimental Rigor

**Ablation Studies**
- Test each component of your approach systematically
- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently
- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)
- Document what changes and what stays constant

**Comparative Framework**
- Compare approaches on identical test sets
- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions
- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)
- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons

**Replication &amp; Reproducibility**
- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes
- Document exact model versions and API endpoints
- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters
- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials
- Consider API versioning changes over time

### 2. Evaluation Methodology

**Multi-Metric Evaluation**
Use diverse metrics appropriate to your task:
- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers
- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval
- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)
- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation
- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals

**Established Benchmarks**
Leverage existing benchmarks when applicable:
- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag
- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests
- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions
- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval
- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)

**Human Evaluation**
When automated metrics insufficient:
- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)
- Provide clear rubrics and examples
- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen&#39;s kappa, Fleiss&#39; kappa)
- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs
- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible

**Statistical Rigor**
- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates
- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)
- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)
- Report effect sizes, not just p-values
- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)

### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

**Systematic Design**
- Start with clear task definition and examples
- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics
- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)
- Document prompt evolution and rationale

**Components to Test**
- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length
- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering
- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form
- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps
- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing

**Failure Analysis**
- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)
- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum
- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs
- Document limitations explicitly

### 4. AI Agent &amp; System Evaluation

**Task Decomposition**
- Define clear success criteria for each subtask
- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes
- Track failure modes at each stage

**Behavioral Analysis**
- Log all agent actions and decisions
- Analyze decision patterns and strategies
- Compare planned vs. actual behavior
- Identify systematic biases or failure modes

**Robustness Testing**
- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)
- Vary input format, phrasing, language
- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature &gt; 0)
- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)

### 5. Benchmark Design Principles

**Quality Criteria**
- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators
- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance
- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution
- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)

**Construction Guidelines**
- Use diverse, representative examples
- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)
- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)
- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines
- Version control and document changes

**Validation Steps**
- Pilot with baseline models
- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts
- Validate with human performance baselines
- Test for bias and fairness issues
- Monitor for data leakage

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. API Integration &amp; Cost Management

**Setup**
```python
import openai
import anthropic
import os
from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt

# Load API keys from environment
openai.api_key = os.getenv(&#34;OPENAI_API_KEY&#34;)
anthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(&#34;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&#34;))

# Rate limiting and retry logic
@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))
def call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=&#34;gpt-4&#34;):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Robust API calling with exponential backoff.&#34;&#34;&#34;
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

**Cost Tracking**
- Estimate costs before running full experiments
- Track token usage (input + output)
- Use cheaper models for development/debugging
- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls

### 2. Data Organization

**Input Data**
```

- Create new test cases or use very recent data

❌ **Cherry-Picking**
- Report all experiments, not just successful ones
- Include negative results and ablations
- Be transparent about hyperparameter tuning

❌ **Overfitting to Benchmarks**
- Test on multiple benchmarks, not just one

- Run multiple times with different seeds (especially at temperature &gt; 0)
- Report standard deviations, not just means
- Check for consistency across runs

❌ **Prompt Leakage**
- Don&#39;t include test answers in prompts or context
- Avoid leading questions that give away the answer
- Check for unintended hints in few-shot examples

## Analysis &amp; Reporting

### 1. Error Analysis

**Categorization**
Create error taxonomy specific to your task:
- Factual errors vs. reasoning errors
- Format/parsing failures vs. content failures
- Systematic patterns vs. random errors

**Qualitative Analysis**
- Sample and manually inspect errors across spectrum
- Identify root causes (data quality, prompt ambiguity, model limitation)
- Document representative examples

### 2. Visualization

**Recommended Plots**
- Performance by difficulty level
- Error rate by category
- Model comparison (bar charts, radar plots)
- Performance vs. cost/latency trade-offs
- Learning curves (few-shot: 0, 1, 3, 5... examples)

### 3. Results Presentation

**Tables**
- Clear headers with metric definitions
- Bold best results, underline second-best
- Include baselines (random, majority, simple heuristic)
- Report confidence intervals or std dev

**Discussion**
- Interpret results in context of hypotheses
- Discuss limitations and failure modes
- Address threats to validity
- Suggest future work based on findings

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### Prompt Engineering Research
- Test on diverse tasks, not just one
- Compare against baseline prompts (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- Measure generalization across models
- Consider prompt length vs. performance trade-offs

### AI Agent Evaluation
- Define clear success metrics for agent tasks
- Log intermediate states and decisions
- Compare against human performance when feasible
- Test tool usage accuracy and efficiency

### Benchmark Creation
- Pilot with baseline models first
- Check for annotation quality and consistency
- Test for unintended biases or shortcuts
- Validate with diverse model families

### LLM Capabilities Studies
- Control for confounds (model size, training data, etc.)
- Test across model families, not just one provider
- Consider emergent abilities at different scales
- Document API behavior changes over time

## Resource Guidance

**Compute Resources**
- For API-based research: CPU is sufficient, no GPU needed
- For model downloads: You MAY download models if needed for research
  - Small models (&lt;7B params): Can run on CPU
  - Larger models (7B-70B): May need GPU, but check if API alternative exists
- RAM: 8-16GB typical; more if loading large models
- Storage: Download datasets and models as needed for research

**Model Selection (2025)**

IMPORTANT: Use state-of-the-art models for credible research results.
CRITICAL: For LLM research, use REAL models (APIs or downloads) and run them with experiments, do not simulate fake models!

**Recommended Models (as of 2025):**
- **GPT-4.1 or GPT-5** (OpenAI, August 2025) - Best for everyday reasoning, coding, reliability
  - API: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-codex` (for coding tasks)
  - Pricing: ~$1.25/M input tokens, ~$10/M output tokens
  - Context: Standard context window

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Anthropic, September 2025) - Best for coding, agents, polished writing
  - API: `claude-sonnet-4-5`
  - Context: 1,000,000 tokens
  - Excels at: Complex B2B workflows, multi-file reasoning, autonomous agents

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google, June 2025) - Best for long context, visual reasoning
  - API: `gemini-2-5-pro`
  - Context: 1,000,000 tokens
  - Features: Computer Use for browser control, excellent multimodal

You may also search models on openrouter. You can assume that we have the api keys available as environment variables
**When to use older/smaller models:**
- Historical baselines: Compare new methods against prior SOTA
- Ablation studies: Test how model size affects phenomenon
- Resource constraints: Explicitly justified (e.g., on-device deployment)

**AVOID using models older than 2024** unless explicitly justified as baseline comparison.
Do NOT use: FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, Claude 2.x, Gemini 1.0 as primary evaluation models.

**When to Download Models vs. Use APIs**

Use APIs when:
- Testing LLM behavior, prompting strategies, calibration
- Benchmarking multiple models
- Multi-agent systems research
- Budget and speed are important

Download models from HuggingFace when:
- Mechanistic interpretability research (need model internals)
- Fine-tuning or training required
- Need offline access or repeated access
- Probing, feature extraction, activation analysis

For downloads:
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
# Small models work on CPU
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(&#34;model-name&#34;)
```

Common model sizes:
- &lt;1B params: Tiny models, CPU-friendly
- 1-7B params: Small models, can run on CPU slowly or GPU
- 7-70B params: Large models, typically need GPU or use API instead

**Cost and Resource Guidance** (not hard limits)

API Costs (typical):
- Small-scale (&lt;1000 examples): $10-50
- Medium-scale (&lt;10000 examples): $50-200
- Large-scale experiments: $200-500+
- Use resources appropriate for your research question
- Document costs in your final report

Time (typical):
- Quick experiments: 1-3 hours
- Full research cycle: 3-8 hours
- Complex multi-day projects are acceptable if needed
- Quality matters more than speed

IMPORTANT: These are GUIDELINES, not hard limits.
- If good research requires more resources, use them
- Don&#39;t compromise research quality to save costs
- Do track and document what you use

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- This is a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION covering all 6 phases
- Resources have been PRE-GATHERED for you - use them!
- Never stop between phases waiting for user input
- If you encounter issues, document them and continue
- Even if experiments fail, complete Phase 6 documenting what happened
- REPORT.md is mandatory - it's the primary deliverable

WORKSPACE DIRECTORY AND DIRECTORY SAFETY:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
You are running in the project workspace directory: /workspaces/humor-recognition-llm-ca34-claude

WORKING DIRECTORY VERIFICATION:
Before creating or writing ANY files, ALWAYS verify you are in the correct directory:

1. Run `pwd` to check your current directory
2. You should be in: /workspaces/humor-recognition-llm-ca34-claude
3. If you're somewhere else, run: cd /workspaces/humor-recognition-llm-ca34-claude

MANDATORY VERIFICATION POINTS - Run `pwd` and verify location:
✓ Before creating any new directories (mkdir results, mkdir figures, etc.)
✓ Before saving any output files
✓ Before running experiments that produce output
✓ After any cd command - ALWAYS cd back to workspace root afterward
✓ When starting each new phase of work

SAFE PATTERN FOR DIRECTORY CHANGES:
If you need to cd into a subdirectory, ALWAYS return immediately:
  pwd                              # Verify starting location
  cd results && python script.py && cd -   # cd back using "cd -"
  pwd                              # Verify you're back in workspace root

⚠️  NEVER create files in parent directory (cd .. is dangerous!)
⚠️  All your work MUST stay within this workspace directory

Remember:
- READ literature_review.md and resources.md first (they're in your current directory)
- Use pre-downloaded datasets from datasets/ directory (relative to current directory)
- Leverage code from code/ directory (relative to current directory)
- Write Python scripts (.py) in src/ for experiments (NOT Jupyter notebooks)
- Use markdown files (.md) for documentation (saved in current directory)
- Save outputs to organized directories: results/, figures/, logs/ (all relative)
- All your work stays within this workspace directory
- Follow the methodology carefully, leveraging the pre-gathered resources

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 6 REQUIREMENTS - WHAT TO INCLUDE IN FINAL DOCUMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

When you reach Phase 6, create these files with ACTUAL results from your experiments:

1. REPORT.md - Comprehensive research report containing:
   - Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs summarizing what you found)
   - Research Question & Hypothesis
   - Literature Review Summary (key papers and insights from Phase 0)
   - Methodology (what you actually did, step-by-step)
     * Datasets/baselines you used and why
     * Evaluation metrics and justification
   - Key Findings (ACTUAL results with supporting data/figures from experiments)
   - Discussion & Interpretation
     * How your results compare to expectations
     * What this means for the research question
   - Limitations & Future Work
   - Conclusion
   - References (papers, datasets, tools used)

   Include key visualizations/tables inline (as markdown).

2. README.md - Quick overview containing:
   - Brief project description (2-3 sentences)
   - Key findings summary (bullet points, 3-5 main results from your experiments)
   - How to reproduce (environment setup, run instructions)
   - File structure overview
   - Link to REPORT.md for full details

   Keep this concise and scannable.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Do NOT create placeholder/stub reports during planning - wait until Phase 6
- If experiments fail or are incomplete, document what you attempted and what happened
- REPORT.md is the PRIMARY DELIVERABLE - it must contain actual findings
- These documents make your research accessible and understandable

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SESSION COMPLETION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The session is COMPLETE when:
✓ All phases (1-6) have been attempted
✓ Pre-gathered resources have been reviewed and used
✓ Experiments were run (even if simple or preliminary)
✓ REPORT.md has been created documenting actual results
✓ README.md has been created with overview
✓ Code is organized with comments
✓ Results are saved to results/ directory

If you reach this point, your research session is finished.
