# NIH Grant Writing Guidelines

## Review Criteria

NIH uses five scored review criteria:

### 1. Significance (Weight: High)
*Does the project address an important problem?*

Questions:
- Does the project address an important problem?
- If successful, how will scientific knowledge advance?
- How will it change concepts, methods, or practices?

### 2. Investigator(s) (Weight: Medium)
*Are the PD/PIs appropriately trained and qualified?*

Questions:
- Appropriate training and experience?
- Track record of productivity?
- Are collaborations well-suited?

### 3. Innovation (Weight: Medium)
*Does the project employ novel concepts, approaches, or methods?*

Questions:
- Does it challenge existing paradigms?
- Are methodologies/technologies novel?
- Are concepts/methods refinements, improvements, or new?

### 4. Approach (Weight: Highest)
*Is the strategy well-reasoned and appropriate?*

Questions:
- Is overall strategy sound?
- Are potential problems acknowledged?
- Are benchmarks and timelines feasible?

### 5. Environment (Weight: Low)
*Is there institutional support?*

Questions:
- Is environment conducive to research?
- Is there evidence of institutional support?

## Common NIH Grant Types

### R01 (Research Project Grant)
- Most common research grant
- Up to 5 years
- Typically $250K-500K/year
- 12-page research strategy

### R21 (Exploratory/Developmental)
- Exploratory/developmental research
- 2 years, $275K total
- 6-page research strategy
- No preliminary data required

### R03 (Small Grant)
- Small research projects
- 2 years, $50K/year
- Limited scope

### K Awards (Career Development)
- K99/R00: Transition to independence
- K01: Mentored research scientist
- K08: Mentored clinical scientist

### F Awards (Fellowships)
- F30: MD/PhD students
- F31: Pre-doctoral
- F32: Post-doctoral

## Proposal Structure

### Overall Structure (R01)
1. Specific Aims (1 page)
2. Research Strategy (12 pages)
   - Significance
   - Innovation
   - Approach
3. Bibliography
4. Biographical Sketch
5. Budget
6. Other attachments

### Specific Aims Page

**Structure**:
- Para 1: Background and significance
- Para 2: Knowledge gap and critical need
- Para 3: Long-term goal and objective
- Para 4: Central hypothesis and rationale
- Aims (numbered list, 2-4 aims)
- Para 5: Expected outcomes and impact

**Tips**:
- Most important page of the application
- Reviewers form impression here
- Must be compelling and clear
- Each aim should be independent

### Research Strategy

**Significance** (1-2 pages):
- Importance of the problem
- How knowledge will advance
- Impact on the field

**Innovation** (0.5-1 page):
- Novel concepts/methods/technologies
- How this changes current thinking
- Advantages over existing approaches

**Approach** (8-9 pages):
For each aim:
- Rationale
- Preliminary data
- Research design
- Methods
- Expected outcomes
- Potential problems and alternatives
- Timeline

## NIH-Specific Tips

### Rigor and Reproducibility
Required to address:
- Scientific premise
- Rigorous experimental design
- Biological variables (sex, etc.)
- Authentication of key resources

### Human Subjects / Vertebrate Animals
If applicable:
- Protection plans required
- IRB/IACUC approval
- Inclusion enrollment report

### Biosketch Format
NIH-specific format:
- Personal statement (why you're qualified)
- Positions and honors
- Contributions to science (up to 5 narratives)

## Study Section Selection

### Choosing the Right Study Section
- Review study section descriptions
- Look at recently funded grants
- Contact Scientific Review Officer
- Use assisted referral tool

### Common CS/AI-Relevant Study Sections
- BDMA (Biomedical Data and Language Processing)
- BMIT (Biomedical Imaging Technology)
- MFSR (Modeling and Analysis of Biological Systems)

## Review Process

### Scoring
- 1-9 scale (1 = exceptional, 9 = poor)
- Overall Impact score
- Individual criterion scores
- Percentile assigned

### What Makes Competitive Scores
- Percentile <20% typically funded
- Varies by institute and fiscal year
- ESI (Early Stage Investigator) has advantages

### Timeline
- Standard receipt dates: Feb 5, Jun 5, Oct 5
- Council review 4 months after submission
- Funding decisions 1-2 months after council

## Budget Guidelines

### Modular Budget (R01 < $250K/year)
- Request in $25K modules
- Less detailed justification
- Typical for most R01s

### Detailed Budget (R01 ≥ $250K/year)
- Line-item budget required
- Detailed justification for each item

### Typical Costs
- Graduate student + tuition: ~$40-50K/year
- Postdoc: ~$55-70K/year (NIH scale)
- Equipment: Justify >$5K
- Indirect costs: Negotiated rate

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not addressing all review criteria**
2. **Weak specific aims page**
3. **Insufficient preliminary data**
4. **Aims that are dependent**
5. **Not addressing rigor and reproducibility**
6. **Scope too broad or too narrow**
7. **Budget misaligned with proposed work**
