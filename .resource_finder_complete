Key findings from literature review:
1. Humor recognition in BERT concentrates in a single attention head (Laughing Heads, 2021)
2. Sentiment is linearly represented along a single direction in LLMs (Tigges et al., 2023)
3. NLP tasks have very low intrinsic dimension (d90~200 for RoBERTa on MRPC; Aghajanyan et al., 2020)
4. No existing work directly measures the rank of humor recognition in LLMs — this is the central gap

Recommended next steps:
1. Adapt eliciting-latent-sentiment code to find humor directions in GPT-2/Pythia
2. Measure intrinsic dimensionality of humor via LoRA and LoReFT rank sweeps
3. Compare humor's representational complexity to sentiment as baseline
4. Validate findings with causal interventions (activation patching, directional ablation)
