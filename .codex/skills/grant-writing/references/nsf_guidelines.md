# NSF Grant Writing Guidelines

## Merit Review Criteria

All NSF proposals are evaluated on two criteria:

### Intellectual Merit

*The potential to advance knowledge*

Questions reviewers consider:
1. What is the potential for the proposed activity to advance knowledge?
2. To what extent does the proposed project suggest original work?
3. Is the plan well-reasoned, organized, and structured?
4. Is there sufficient access to resources?

**How to address**:
- Clearly state research questions
- Explain why these questions matter
- Show how your approach is novel
- Demonstrate feasibility with preliminary data
- Present clear methodology

### Broader Impacts

*The potential to benefit society and contribute to desired outcomes*

Questions reviewers consider:
1. What is the potential for societal benefits?
2. To what extent will it enhance scientific understanding?
3. To what extent will it promote teaching and diversity?
4. Will results be disseminated broadly?

**How to address**:
- Be specific about outreach activities
- Include measurable outcomes
- Connect broader impacts to your research
- Show track record if possible

## Common NSF Programs for ML/AI

### CAREER Award
*Faculty Early Career Development Program*

- For tenure-track faculty within first 3 years
- 5 years of support (~$500K-600K)
- Must integrate research and education
- Strong track record and institutional support needed

### CRII
*Research Initiation Initiative*

- For early career researchers
- 2 years, ~$175K
- Cannot have had prior NSF funding
- Good stepping stone to CAREER

### Core Programs

**CISE (Computer & Information Science & Engineering)**:
- CCF (Computing and Communication Foundations)
- IIS (Information and Intelligent Systems)
- CNS (Computer and Network Systems)

**Cross-cutting**:
- CISE-MSI (minority-serving institutions)
- HDR (Harnessing the Data Revolution)

## Proposal Structure

### Cover Sheet
- Title (concise, informative)
- Duration and requested amount
- Program selection

### Project Summary (1 page max)
Three separate sections:
1. Overview
2. Intellectual Merit
3. Broader Impacts

### Project Description (15 pages max)
1. Introduction
2. Background/Related Work
3. Proposed Research
4. Broader Impacts
5. Results from Prior NSF Support (if any)

### References Cited
- No page limit
- Include all cited work

### Budget and Justification
- Personnel (with percentages)
- Equipment
- Travel
- Other direct costs
- Indirect costs

### Biographical Sketches (3 pages each)
- Professional preparation
- Appointments
- Publications (10 most relevant)
- Synergistic activities

### Facilities and Equipment
- Describe available resources

### Data Management Plan (2 pages)
- How will data be managed and shared?

## Writing Tips

### Language to Use
- "We propose to..." (confident)
- "This research will advance..."
- "The expected outcomes include..."
- "We hypothesize that..."

### Language to Avoid
- "We hope to..." (too tentative)
- "We will try to..." (not confident)
- "This might lead to..." (uncertain)

### Formatting Tips
- Use clear section headers
- Include figures and diagrams
- Use white space effectively
- Bold key terms
- Number paragraphs or use bullets

## Review Process

### Panel Review
- 3-5 reviewers read full proposal
- Panel discusses and ranks
- Program officer makes final decision

### Individual Review Criteria (each scored 1-5)
- Intellectual Merit
- Broader Impacts
- Integration of Research and Education (CAREER)

### Common Reasons for Rejection
1. Lack of novelty/innovation
2. Weak broader impacts
3. Insufficient preliminary data
4. Overly ambitious scope
5. Poor writing/organization
6. Not appropriate for program

## Timeline
