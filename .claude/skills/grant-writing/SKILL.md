# Grant Writing

Guidance for preparing research grant proposals.

## When to Use

- Preparing grant applications
- Developing research plans
- Writing broader impacts statements
- Creating project timelines
- Budgeting research projects

## Grant Proposal Structure

### Standard Components

| Component | Purpose | Typical Length |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Abstract/Summary** | Concise overview | 1 page |
| **Specific Aims** | Goals and hypotheses | 1 page |
| **Introduction** | Background and significance | 2-3 pages |
| **Research Plan** | Detailed methodology | 6-12 pages |
| **Broader Impacts** | Societal benefits | 1-2 pages |
| **Timeline** | Project schedule | 1 page |
| **Budget** | Financial plan | Agency-specific |
| **References** | Citations | As needed |

## Writing by Section

### Abstract/Summary

**Goal**: Enable reviewers to understand the project quickly.

**Structure** (usually 1 page):
1. Problem and significance (2-3 sentences)
2. Knowledge gap (1-2 sentences)
3. Central hypothesis (1 sentence)
4. Specific aims overview (2-3 sentences)
5. Expected outcomes (2-3 sentences)
6. Impact/significance (1-2 sentences)

**Tips**:
- Write last, after rest of proposal is complete
- Make it self-contained
- Include key methods
- Emphasize innovation and impact

### Specific Aims

**Goal**: Clear, compelling statement of objectives.

**Structure** (typically 1 page):
1. **Opening paragraph**: Hook + significance + gap
2. **Central hypothesis**: One clear statement
3. **Specific Aim 1**: First objective
4. **Specific Aim 2**: Second objective
5. **Specific Aim 3**: Third objective (optional)
6. **Expected outcomes**: What success looks like
7. **Impact statement**: Why this matters

**Aim Format**:
```markdown
**Aim N: [Action verb] [What] [To achieve what]**

Hypothesis: [Testable statement]
Approach: [Brief method description]
Expected outcome: [What we'll learn/produce]
```

**Good Aim Characteristics**:
- Clear and testable
- Achievable in proposed timeframe
- Each aim contributes to overall goal
- Aims are related but not dependent
- Failure of one aim doesn't doom others

### Research Plan

**Introduction/Background**:
- Establish significance
- Review relevant literature
- Identify knowledge gap
- State how you'll address the gap

**Preliminary Data** (if applicable):
- Show feasibility
- Demonstrate expertise
- Support proposed approach
- Present pilot results

**Research Design and Methods**:

For each aim:
```markdown
## Aim N: [Title]

### Rationale
[Why this aim is important]

### Approach
[Detailed methodology]

### Expected Results
[What you anticipate finding]

### Potential Problems and Alternatives
[Risks and mitigation strategies]

### Timeline
[When this aim will be completed]
```

### Broader Impacts

**Categories** (NSF):
1. Advancing knowledge and understanding
2. Promoting teaching, training, mentoring
3. Broadening participation of underrepresented groups
4. Enhancing infrastructure for research/education
5. Disseminating results broadly
6. Benefiting society

**Tips**:
- Be specific and concrete
- Show track record if possible
- Connect to your research
- Include measurable outcomes

### Timeline and Milestones

**Gantt Chart Format**:

| Task | Y1 Q1 | Y1 Q2 | Y1 Q3 | Y1 Q4 | Y2 Q1 | Y2 Q2 | ... |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| Aim 1.1 | X | X | | | | | |
| Aim 1.2 | | X | X | | | | |
| Aim 2.1 | | | X | X | X | | |
| Milestone 1 | | | M | | | | |
| ... | | | | | | | |

**Key Milestones**:
- Define clear go/no-go decision points
- Include deliverables
- Show interdependencies

## Agency-Specific Guidance

### NSF

**Key Criteria**:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: Potential to advance knowledge
2. **Broader Impacts**: Benefit to society

**Tips**:
- Balance both criteria equally
- Be explicit about how you address each
- Use their exact language

**Common Programs** (CS/ML):
- CAREER (early career faculty)
- CRII (research initiation)
- Core Programs (CCF, IIS, CNS)
- SaTC (security)

### NIH

**Key Criteria**:
1. **Significance**: Does it address an important problem?
2. **Investigator(s)**: Are researchers qualified?
3. **Innovation**: Does it employ novel concepts?
4. **Approach**: Is methodology sound?
5. **Environment**: Is institutional support adequate?

**Tips**:
- Frame in terms of health impact
- Include preliminary data
- Address rigor and reproducibility

### DARPA

**Key Characteristics**:
- High-risk, high-reward
- Transformative potential
- Clear metrics
- Aggressive timelines

**Tips**:
- Emphasize breakthrough potential
- Show awareness of state-of-the-art
- Define clear success metrics
- Include go/no-go decision points

## Common Mistakes

### Content Mistakes
- Vague or untestable hypotheses
- Aims that are dependent (all-or-nothing)
- Overpromising what can be achieved
- Not addressing potential failures
- Weak preliminary data

### Structural Mistakes
- Too much background, not enough plan
- Burying key points
- Not following page limits
- Unclear organization
- Missing required sections

### Tone Mistakes
- Too tentative ("we hope to...")
- Too arrogant ("we will definitively prove...")
- Not acknowledging risks
- Ignoring competition

## Quality Checklist

### Before Submission
